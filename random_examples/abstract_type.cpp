/*
C++ demonstration of abstract classes.

Points to note:
-you cannot create an instance of an abstract class. You have to keep a pointer
or reference to it instead
-if you inherit from an abstract class, you need to implement all the (pure) virtual
members in order to be able to define an instance of that derived class.
